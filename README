This is a simple demo app showing how to use TCP. It acts as a simple
terminal program, sending one character at a time to the hard-coded
remote echo server.

- While disconnected, any ASCII key will init a connect.
- CTRL-D closes the socket.
- CTRL-C exits.

The code also shows how to set up and maintain timer events.
